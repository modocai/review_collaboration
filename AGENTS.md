## Pull Request Rules

Every PR must pass the review loop (`review-loop.sh --dry-run`) before merging. No exceptions. We eat our own dog food — if Mr. Overkill can't approve it, neither can you.

## Branch Rules

Always commit and push before ending work on any branch other than develop.
Never commit directly to `main` or `develop`. All changes must go through branch → PR → review before merge.
Never rebase or force-push `main` or `develop` — this destroys shared history.

## PR Merge Process

Before merging a PR, always fetch the target branch and check for new commits:

```
git fetch origin <target-branch>
git log HEAD..origin/<target-branch> --oneline
```

**A) Target branch has new commits:**
1. Merge the target branch into your feature branch (`git merge origin/<target-branch>`)
2. Resolve conflicts if any
3. Push the merge commit
4. Re-run the review loop — the merged code must pass review again

**B) Target branch is up to date:**
1. Merge the PR (`gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch`)
2. Switch to the target branch, pull, and delete the local feature branch

## Commit Messages

Principles:
- Write the subject in English, capturing the motivation/context of the change
- Keep conventional commit prefixes (fix, feat, refactor, etc.)
- Add a detailed body after a blank line if needed
